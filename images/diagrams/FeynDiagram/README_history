History of FeynDiagram versions:

2.6   8/13/03	Bill Dimm
       Fixed bounding boxes that were wrong when the width of a
       line was set to a negative value (e.g. to flip a gluon).  

       Made bounding boxes take line thickness and arrows into account.

       Added FeynDiagram::pad_bbox(top, right, bottom, left)
       which allows you to adjust bounding box padding on all sides
       of the diagram (padding is specified in the diagram's coordinate
       system).  This can be useful for things like text (where
       FeynDiagram approximates the bounding box, but might be off).
       The default padding (when using the default coordinate system
       configuration) is 0.12 on all sides (was 0 in previous versions).

2.5   4/17/00	Bill Dimm
       Minor adjustments to remove some warnings and errors
       that occur with g++ 2.91.66.

2.4   10/16/95	Bill Dimm
       Added vertex_box::fill and FeynDiagram::vertex_box_fill so that
       you can turn off the filling of the box vertex (by default it
       still fills).  The tutorial has not been updated to document this
       feature.  An example:

	   FeynDiagram fd(pg);
	   vertex_box vtx(fd,xy(0,0));
	   vtx.fill.setfalse();  /* turn off fill for this vertex */
	   fd.vertex_box_fill.setfalse();  /* default is no fill for diagram */

2.3   9/3/95	Bill Dimm
       Fixed some occurences of 'cout' that should have been 'out' - this
       caused problems when trying to output directly to a file instead of 
       outputting to stdout (ie. cout) as is done in the tutorial.

2.2   12/13/94	Bill Dimm
       Changed 
          #include <stream.h> 
       to 
          #include <iostream.h>

2.1   12/13/94	Bill Dimm
       Changed true() to settrue() and false() to setfalse()
       for compatibility with ANSI standard which now has true and false
       as reserved words.  This may cause some incompatibility
       with programs for old versions (sorry).

       Changed BoundingBox so that values are integers (instead of
       real numbers) so figures should now display on newer versions of xdvi.

       Added ontop() to various line types so that you can make
       a line appear to go over another one.

       Added to the text processor: 
          \minus \widetilde \tildebar \overrightarrow

       Also added the ability to use a different font in the middle of text
       with: \font{fontname}{text}

       Now gives warnings if you give a negative value for a radius.

1.22  7/10/94	Bill Dimm
       Previously, FeynDiagram had one large prolog file.  This file
       has been broken into several small ones which are only inserted into
       the output as needed - this should make the output somewhat smaller.

1.21  11/9/93	Bill Dimm
       Made a change to "fd.C" to circumvent the peculiar behavior of a VMS
       compiler which was causing it to produce mangled output (outputting
       the last chuck of "prolog.ps" twice).

1.20  11/4/93	Bill Dimm
       Made some changes to "fd.C" so that it will compile OK even if 
       M_PI isn't defined in your "math.h" header file.

1.19  11/3/93	Bill Dimm
       Added the NOOSFCN option so that it can be compiled even if your
       C++ compiler doesn't have the header file "osfcn.h"

1.18  10/27/93	Bill Dimm
       Corrected a minor bug in arcthru which caused it to sometimes
       draw the arc the wrong way (due to a rounding error)

1.17  6/3/93	Bill Dimm
       The first public release.
