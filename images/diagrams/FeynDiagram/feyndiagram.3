.SH NAME
FeynDiagram - library for drawing Feynman diagrams in PostScript.

.SH DESCRIPTION
FeynDiagram allows you to create high quality PostScript Feynman diagrams
by writing a short C++ program to describe the diagram.
A printed tutorial-style manual is available (see the FILES section
below for the location of the example programs on this system).
Note that executable programs produced with C++ are often large, so it is
a good idea to remove the executable after you have used it to generate
PostScript output.

.SH EXAMPLE
To compile a program called "prog.C" which uses FeynDiagram, and generate
an executable called "prog", do:

.B "CC -o prog prog.C -lFD -lm"

See the FILES section below for the location of example programs which
use FeynDiagram.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Programs which use the FeynDiagram library will automatically print
messages about their progress and any errors encountered to the screen
(stderr) when they are run.

.SH BUGS
The \\overline control sequence (for creating a line over text) doesn't
put the line in the right place when the text is rotated - I don't know why.

If you use long text strings, the bounding box might not be quite right.

Using special positioning with long text strings
(more than about 25 characters) may
cause your printer to run out of memory and abort the page.

There are no copy constructors yet.
