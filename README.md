This is *Quantum Ethics*, an [Open Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) project designed to develop a mathematically and conceptually coherent Quantum Field Theory and to derive its ethical implications. A full regularization of the Standard Model, based on a lattice formulation, is being used to achieve mathematical well-definedness. [Quantum Measurement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Measurement_Problem) is being related to [phenomenal consciousness](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/), as suggested by the parallel reading of Spinoza's [*Ethics*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3800) and of von Neumann's [*Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691028931). One of the key results is the derivation of a recurrence theorem for mental states, called `Reincarnation theorem'. This work is being published as a [PDF](http://quantum-ethics.org/Quantum%20Ethics.php) on [quantum-ethics.org](http://quantum-ethics.org/) and as a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Ethics-Spinozist-Interpretation-Theory/dp/1481811703/) by the [CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform](https://www.createspace.com/).

If you are interested in getting involved in this project at any level — as a co-author, as a peer-reviewer or simply to give me feedback —, please feel free to contact me at sebastien.fauvel@gmx.ch, or directly fill in an [issue](https://github.com/quantum-ethics/quantum-ethics/issues) and/or fork this repository and send me a pull request. I would really appreciate your help!
