This is *Quantum Ethics*, an [Open Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) project designed to develop a mathematically and conceptually coherent Quantum Field Theory and to derive its ethical implications. The results are being published as a [PDF](http://quantum-ethics.org/Quantum%20Ethics.php) on [quantum-ethics.org](http://quantum-ethics.org/) and as a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Ethics-Spinozist-Interpretation-Theory/dp/1481811703/) by the [CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform](https://www.createspace.com/).

If you are interested in getting involved in this project at any level — as a co-author, as a peer-reviewer or simply to give me feedback —, please feel free to contact me at sebastien.fauvel@gmx.ch, or directly fill in an [issue](https://github.com/sebastien-fauvel/quantum-ethics/issues) and/or make a pull request to this repository. I would really appreciate your help!
